# iptables-GUI-project
A python-based GUI for iptables. Created as a project for SJSU/Fullstack Academy Cyber bootcamp
This is a python script designed to be run on Linux that generates a window. The window contains a simple graphical alternative to the most basic functions of iptables.
The radio buttons allow you to essentially create the command line interface (CLI) command necessary to achieve the effect indicated in the window without needing to type out or actually know the relevant CLI syntax. 
The script needs to be run as root because iptables needs to run as root, and this script is just running iptables' CLI commands when you press the buttons on the GUI.
